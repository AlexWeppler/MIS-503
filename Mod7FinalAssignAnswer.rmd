### Zillow Home Value Index Analysis

### Wake County Home Sales 
a. What have been the overall trends in Wake County Home Values?
    
 It seems that the overall trends are almost cyclical, with moments of up and down. Overall, values have steadily risen, but there have been low periods throughout. 
    
b. There were dips in home values in the past 20 years. What years did these occur?

 There was a dip 1997- 1999 and also 2008-2012.
 
c. Based on the analysis, where would be the least expensive area to purchase home? Most expensive
area?

 The least expensive area to buy a home would be Zebulon. The most expensive area to buy a house would be Apex.
 
d. Are any area home values trending down? Is there one area that stands out compared to others?

  Yes, while everyone had an overall increase, you can tell that some areas, while competitive to other areas on the scatter plot in the 90"s, have dropped value in comparison into the late 2000's. The most noticable one seems to be Raleigh (the blue is very hard to differentiate, I think its Raleigh). Its home values were comparable to Knightsdale, Mooresville, and others. In recent years, those values have grown exponentially, while Raleigh is only remaining a constant with inflation trends.
